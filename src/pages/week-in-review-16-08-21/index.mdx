This week we’re excited to release our very first, ‘Week in review’. The week in review will be posted weekly on our product blog to ensure that everyone involved or interested in what we’re building at rulebox are aware of the progress made and what’s in the pipeline for the coming weeks.

Moving forward we plan to create a product roadmap for both [PDFx](https://harnessdata.ai/product/pdfx) and [ADDRESSABLE](https://harnessdata.ai/product/addressable) to keep us honest and true.

## What to expect in the week in review

The week in review will be a high level summary of all things attempted, achieved and released. It’s a super informal way of updating anyone that is interested about developments within the tech team.

## What’s been worked on

### PDFx

We have started work on upgrading our admin dashboard. The feedback from clients over the past couple of weeks has been invaluable in helping us to plan and scope out this project. Whilst it’s only in the design phase at present we hope that this will have a real benefit on clients being able to achieve everything that they need within the platform.

We’ve also continued to work on tidying up a few elements of PDFx including the settings pop-up modal and the datapoint drag and drop aesthetics.

Whilst Folders were scheduled to be released as part of the upcoming 'canary' release we appreciated the benefit that folders will have to our users. For that reason we are implementing them on the current version of PDFx to ensure that they can be used immediately. Folders will be available to select clients in the coming weeks.

### Addressable

As we continue to ingest more data and understand connections further we have started to utilise MapReduce and GraphQL to ensure that subscribers can query the data more efficiently.

We have also added some of our PPSM data to the Addressable UI so that graphs and charts can easily be created & viewed for the respective search area.

We’re also in the process of finalising our latest ADDRESSABLE marketing video to help people who work with UK Address data to better understand how ADDRESSABLE allows them to better utilise the data that they already have using address connections.
